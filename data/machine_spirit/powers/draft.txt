machine spirit origin

darkness or blindness outside range?

bonuses? how many? health, vision, speed, jump?, ; tradeoffs? durability (health loss?)?
log: "natural", swimming, maybe regen
stone: slower
iron: healthy, faster
copper: same but lightning?
gold: speed but -health
diamond: ...shiny?
netherite: no lava, no fire, maybe just entirely invincible
modded stuff

graves don't interact with this as-is, is that needed? is there a way to store the items in a chest?

powered rail, observer, piston, dropper, dispenser, detector rail

from praoubl:
gold could pacify piglins
stone could camouflage underground and drop cobble when damaged
 the redstone's the bit that gets damaged, but i could modify it for cobble on death
snow could freeze things it punches, and soul sand could be neutral with undead mobs
and copper could act like a lightning rod (and be immune to lightning damage) to damage nearby enemies
 can't make it act like a lightning bolt, but could make it randomly summon lightning in thunderstorms
it could oxidize like the copper golem origin
 meh
and maybe be resistant to negative effects because copper is antimicrobial
 only microbial condition would be the poisons
soul sand would resist wither tho
invert instant health and instant damage too \n if possible
 pretty sure negative damage is clamped to 0
wood could take more damage from axes but be faster because it’s lighter
if dirt’s standing on grass maybe it has a chance to turn it into grass and then when you shift click with bonemeal you get a random flower
 they're stored as an integer
quartz could have electric thorns damage because when quartz is compressed it makes a bit of electricity
prismarine could have water breathing, if the others don’t
